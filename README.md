The third and final task of the Creative Coding workshop was to develop a generative poster. We had a number of suggested themes to choose from, but we were also completely free to choose a theme of our choice. 
As before, we started with the basics and put the idea into words. Based on the choice of theme, I quickly decided on "Break the pattern", because I find it very interesting how randomly you can make a programmed sketch look. 

The idea was to create a poster that could cause complete chaos with a minimum of interaction. For this reason I aligned the spheres in a grid. But by the interaction of the user with his cursor, he can break this pattern quickly. A simple movement with the mouse is enough to completely mess up the spheres. 
With a click, however, this grid is completely reset, so that the poster is once again calm.
